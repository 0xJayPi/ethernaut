## Ethernaut Exploits

I'll use this repo to track my approach to hack each level of The Ethernaut

Folders Structure:
- instance: levels files from the contract instances
- test: exploit for each level in a forked chain
- script: exploit for each level in the actual chain
- broadcast: transactions record in sepolia

Wallet Used: ```Sepolia: 0x9606e11178a83C364108e99fFFD2f7F75C99d801```
